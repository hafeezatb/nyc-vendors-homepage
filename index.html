  <p> The death of George Floyd has served as a sort of virtue signaling for companies across all work sectors, including those in Hollywood. But, before his untimely passing, there was already work being done to address the lack of diversity within the industry. Hashtags like #OscarsSoWhite called for those at the top to address the inequality in opportunity of roles and praise within Hollywood.

  <p>Between 2018 and 2020, there was an increase of diversity between the division of lead roles by race. Some of the most significant changes include the increase of Black roles by approximately 5%, and the roles played by Middle Eastern/North African (MENA) people increased to over 1%. But, these changes are still not enough. White roles still take up the majority of parts, and while the racial makeup of the United States is reflected similarly amongst the roles occupied, years of exclusion and majority white productions are not rectified by these small victories.
